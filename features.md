- Create a new Enumerable wrapper around an existing slice
- All operations utilizes lazy loading
- Can chain operations
- Data structure to support lazy loading in custom functions
- Fully uses generics
- Select
- Where
- ToMap
- ToSlice
- Take, Skip, TakeWhile, SkipWhile
- OrderBy, OrderByDesc
- First -> (T, bool)
- Any
- Count
- Next (used in for loops to iterate over Enumerable)
